## Design
We determined that the bounded contexts of the problem domain would align with the three main portions of our application: Automobile Inventory, Automobile Service, and Automobile Sales. The Service and Sales microservices poll the Inventory for automobile data, which is then consumed and utilized within the respective microservice. For a more detailed look at our bounded contexts and overall application design, please see the diagram below.
