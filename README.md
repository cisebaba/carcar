## Design
We determined that the bounded contexts of the problem domain would align with the three main portions of our application: Automobile Inventory, Automobile Service, and Automobile Sales. We began first with bulding out the Inventory front end to better understand the existing models and APIs. We determined that the Service and Sales microservices would poll the Inventory for automobile data, which is then utilized within the respective microservice. For a more detailed look at our bounded contexts and overall application design, please see the diagram below.
